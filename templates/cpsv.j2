{% block introduction %}
        <p>
            This document describes a <strong>vocabulary</strong>, in this case <strong>{{ metadata.title }}</strong>. 
	    A vocabulary is a semantic data specification designed so that the included terms are highly reusable.
	    The included classes and properties come with a limited set of constraints.
        </p>
        <p>
        CPSV, the Core Public Service Vocabulary, is a vocabulary for describing Public Services. This Vocabulary combined with <a href="https://github.com/SEMICeu/Consolidated-Core-Vocabularies">the SEMIC eGovernment Core Vocabularies</a> supports <a href="https://github.com/SEMICeu/CPSV-AP">CPSV-AP</a>.
        </p>

{% block summary %}
<section id="abstract">
The Core Public Service Vocabulary is one of the Core Vocabularies that have been developed by the SEMIC action of the former ISA² Programme,
which is now named Interoperable Europe.
 The specification is developed in an open process with the active involvement of the SEMIC action stakeholders including:
  The e-Government Core Vocabularies Working Group (with a total of 69 people from 22 countries, 19 EU and 3 non-EU countries (USA, South-Africa, and Norway), and several EU Institutions and the Directorate-General for Digital Services: DG DIGIT.

    <h2>Status</h2>
        <p>
            This vocabulary has the status {{ metadata.documentconfig.statuslabel if metadata.documentconfig.statuslabel else metadata.statuslabel }} published at {{ metadata.issued }}. This Vocabulary is in its final form and will not be updated or changed.
            This Vocabulary will remain a {{ metadata.documentconfig.statuslabel if metadata.documentconfig.statuslabel else metadata.statuslabel }} and it will remain supported.
            If new concepts are needed to support CPSV-AP these will be included in <a href="https://github.com/SEMICeu/Consolidated-Core-Vocabularies">the Core Vocabularies defined under the m8g name space</a>.
            If you are not yet reusing CPSV but are considering to do so we advice to first consult <a href="https://github.com/SEMICeu/Consolidated-Core-Vocabularies">the other Core Vocabularies</a> and <a href="https://github.com/SEMICeu/ADMS?tab=readme-ov-file">ADMS</a> as these Vocabularies are actively maintained and kept up to date.
        </p>
        <p>
           This latest version is a re-release of <a href="https://github.com/SEMICeu/CPSV/releases/tag/v1.0.1">version 1.0.1</a>. It is intended to provide this Vocabulary in a human readable manner in line with the other SEMIC assets.
